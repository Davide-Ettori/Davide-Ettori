### Davide Ettori

I am a double Master Degree student at PoliMi and UIC Chicago, studying computer science with an AI specialization. 

After obtaining a strong scientific formation in my Computer Engineering Bachelor, I'm now exploring Artificial Intelligence from both a Mathematical and Computer Science prospective.
