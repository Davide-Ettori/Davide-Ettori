### Davide Ettori

I am a double Master Degree student at PoliMi and UIC Chicago, studying computer science with an AI specialization. 

After obtaining a scientific formation in my Computer Engineering Bachelor, I'm now exploring Artificial Intelligence from both a Mathematical and Computer Science prospective, paying attention to the Philosophical or Ethical issues arising from it.

Currently focusing on both studying and researching following my passion for the whole scientific sphere.
